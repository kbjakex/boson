# Boson

A Vulkan abstraction layer that makes graphics easy and enjoyable.

## Features

- [x] Simplified API surface: No more 1000 LOC to draw a triangle (takes about 300-500).
- [x] Shader hot reloading.
- [x] Bindless shader resource model.
- [x] Render graph implementation: featuring resource tracking and automatic synchronization.
- [ ] Render graph optimization: There is still more work to do to make this as fast as possible.
- [ ] Full Vulkan support: I want this library to allow you to do anything Vulkan offers, so if something is not present, submit an issue or PR.

## Todo / Ideas for improvement

Have an idea? Let me know through an issue or PR.

- Move away from nightly requirement (it is not necessary).
- Create examples.
- Built-in error handling (no more having to use Vulkan Configuration / debug messaging)
- Add all formats.
- Add hardware raytracing support.
- Better glslang integration. (stop using Vulkan SDK through shell process and instead integrate through bindings)
- Custom compiler traits and more shader language support (HLSL)?

## Design Philosophy

### Simple yet efficient.

This library is meant to simplify Vulkan without sacrificing usability.

### Built-ins

In addition, it is meant to contain common patterns and practices that level up the graphics programming experience (such as bindless resources).

### Performant

It is also meant to be a thin layer above Vulkan, thus not sacrificing any performance.

### Move fast, break things

This library is under constant development so that it can meet any requirements. Thus, backwards compatibility is not yet a concern.
